 Strict mode eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors
 Strict mode fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical code that’s not strict mode.
 It prevents, or throws errors, when relatively “unsafe” actions are taken (such as gaining access to the global object).
 Strict mode makes it easier to write “secure” JavaScript
